        after the wait, all the books this reader requested will be checked, on each book being available
        the book will be marked borrowed by the writer_modify and while that happens other threads will be paused
        write operation can be done in miliseconds and it doesnt really matter if we put a lock for that, but we will incorporate sleep just to show the mutex functionality and synchronization
        so does the sleep also pause during the lock, since each reader is calling this write_modify, it is actually the parent, so does the parent halt too?
        write_modify will have this lock that stops the reader threads to proceed during that time

fgets parses entire line, like abc wagera including \n, we can convert the strings safely
but what if we require number, it reads abc, atoi's this
scanf only numbers, and stops as soon as something invalid
scanf leaves the incorrect input as it is in the buffer(what is a buffer?)
next scanf reads it and repeats
scanf doesnt consume \n too, so \n stays in the buffer, next scanf might consider it as valid input(why?)
but they would'nt end unless we specify something? or \n just means enter so empty input

input[strcspn(input, "\n")] = \0

By default, sscanf treats spaces, tabs, and newlines as delimiters

 if (sscanf(input, "%d", &choice) != 1)
{
    // returns the number of values read in the specified format
    printf("Invalid input. Please enter 1, 2, or 3.\n");

2d array =  reallocate(this array, this many blocks, and this data type)
so basically adds a new block to existing array - but how?
just add a new block, relocate if not fit

ri->booknames[ri->totalbooksborrowed] = strdup(bookname);
// ri->booknames[ri->totalbooksborrowed] = bookname;
// where bookname is the dynamic string, and that also a dynamically allocated - so what issue?
// each element holds pointer to char*
// char* points to a string in memory, = pe pointer is copied, so 2 pointers same memory
// dup solves this

// basically (stack) is shared between threads - here this bi is in stack rn and if this goes to the new thread in stack and if main ends before, since it is in the main's stack then probelms

// but luckily for us this doesnt get passed - it does actually but because of join main wont end until it done hence no issues

// we could've done detach, heap copy banegi of data in stack
